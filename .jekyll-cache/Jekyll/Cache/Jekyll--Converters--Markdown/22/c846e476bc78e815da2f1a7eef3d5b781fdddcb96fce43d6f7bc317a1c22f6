<br />
<br />Explanation:
<br /><br />
Issues:
<br />
Highest SV% players have very low shots against (SA), so the sample size is very small. Larger sample sizes (larger SA) could provide more accurate SV%, and provide a smaller margin of error.
<br /><br />
Fix issue:
<br />
We can only consider players who have at least the average number of SA, and then sort by SV%.</p>

<p>In determining a goalie‚Äôs performance, other features that could potentially be useful may be Shots Against (SA), Goals-Against Average (GAA), Goalie Point Shares (GPS), and Games Played (GP) and Won (W).
<br /><br />
Having a high SA would mean a larger sample size for SV%. Larger sample sizes (larger SA) could provide more accurate SV%, and provide a smaller margin of error.
<br /><br />
GAA calculates the number of goals allowed per 60 minutes played. So, the lower GAA, the better performance of the goalie.
<br /><br />
GPS is an estimate of the number of points contributed by a player due to his play in goal. So beyond only metrics about the goals a goalie saved, this metric shows how many points they were able to help score. The higher GPA, the better performance of the goalie.
<br /><br />
At the end of the day, what matters after a game is winning. A goalie does a lot more to impact a game than what appears only in his post-game stats such as stopping ‚Äúdump-ins‚Äù. Therefore, a higher win percentage by calculating W/GP could also be potentially useful in determining a goalie‚Äôs performance..</p>

<p>First, we figured out the Game ID naming rules based on the API. Then we tested IDs and printed out JSON data on terminal.</p>

<p><img src="assets/q2_image_0.png" alt="screenshot" /></p>

<p>Next, within Python code, it loops over the years and saves data properly. The downloaded JSON files are categorized by game types and years.</p>

<br />
<br />Explanation:
<br />
In this debug tool, user can select season from all year options, and select season from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">regular_season</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">playoffs</code>. The tool finds out the game numbers and the event index, then adjusts slider sizes.
<br />
At the same time, the event shot coordinates shows on the rink image as a blue dot.</p>

<p>We used library <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matplotlib</code> to draw the coordinates and to add the background image, and used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ipwidgets</code> to add the interactive functionality.</p>

<h2 id="question-4">Question 4</h2>
<h3 id="41">4.1</h3>
<p><img src="assets/q4_1.png" alt="screenshot" /></p>

<h3 id="42">4.2</h3>
<p>We know that the strength of players on the ice starts off being even. So starting off, every event will be at even strength (5 on 5) until a penalty occurs. When a penalty occurs, the strength will change. The team whose player received a penalty will go to the penalty box leaving his team short handed and giving the other team a power play. This changes the strength of the players to 5 on 4. A penalty will last a certain number of minutes depending on the type of penalty. So, the strength of the players will change back to even automatically once the penalty expires, and we can check the game time of every event to know when to change the player strength back. Another possibility is if the team that has a power play scores a goal. Then, the strength will also change back to even.</p>

<h3 id="43">4.3</h3>
<p>In hockey, a rebound occurs when a puck gets shot and bounces off the frame of the goal post. We can speculate that shots or goals could have came from a rebound by paying attention to the time this event occurred and the previous event that occurred. If the previous event was a shot from the same team and happened within maybe 2 seconds, it is likely that the current shot came off of a rebound.
<br />
According to the youtube video linked in the instructions, a play off the rush appears to be when a single player is rushing towards the end he is trying to score with defenders trying to chase him to stop him. I don‚Äôt know anything about hockey but I assume this happens when everyone is on one side of the rink and then possession changes all of a sudden (hence why there are no defenders on their goal side and they are chasing the player rushing). Possessions change when there is a giveaway or takeaway event. So, we can speculate that a players shot or goal came off the rush if the previous event was a giveaway or a takeaway and occurred within a few seconds.</p>

<p>To TA: we built this interactive graph using Dash, and then deployed it on Heroku, it runs kind of slowly. 
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Once you select ‚Äòyear‚Äô and ‚Äòteam‚Äô from the dropdown, please wait for 10 seconds, then you‚Äôll see the fancy graph! ;)</p>

<p>Firstly, we translated all shots to be shot towards the left post. So, for all shots that were supposed to be shot towards the right side, we rotated those coordinates by 180 degrees. This way, we don‚Äôt see a mix of shots taken from the entire rink.
<br /><br />
We calculated league average to be the total number of shots and goals among all teams divided by the number of teams per square feet on the rink. We then tallied the number of shots at every location for a given team. The plot then shows the difference between the number of shots and goals a specific team took compared with the league average. So from these plots, we can see how many more shots or how many less shots a team shot from specific locations on the hockey rink compared with the league average for a specific season. We can interpret these plots like a heat map. The darker the shade of pink at a specific location on the ice rink, the more shots the team took compared with the league average. The lighter the shade of pink at a specific location on the ice rink the less shots the team took compared with the league average.</p>

<br />
Looking at the Colorado Avalanche (AVA) shot map for the 2016-2017 season, we can see that there are more yellow areas than purple areas near the goal post. So, we can say that they took less shots or got less goals near the goal post than the league average. Otherwise, for the rest of the plot, there are small areas where AVA took more shots than league average (in purple), and less shots than league average (in yellow (you would have to look closely)). It is hard to pinpoint anything unique about any of the rest of the area.
<br /><br />
Looking at the AVA shot map for the 2020-2021 season, we can see that there is less yellow near the goal post than the league average and also less yellow than their shot map in 2016-2017. This means they took more shots near the goal post in the 2020-2021 season, so their strategy changed.
<br /><br />
Looking at the standings for the 2016-2017 season, AVA was 17/31. In 2020-2021, AVA was 1/31 . This makes sense because from question 5.2, we concluded that shots shot from the least distance yielded the highest goal percentage. Shots near the goal post are shots shot from the least distance. Since AVA shot more shots near the goal post in the 2020-2021 season, they should have scored more goals, which makes sense since they became 1st overall in standings in 2020-2021.</p>

The shot maps of the Buffalo Sabres (BUF) for the seasons 2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21 are all very spread out. We can even see shots shot above league average taken from even the far corners (x-coord: &lt;20, y-coord: &lt;10), (&gt;60, &lt;10), (&lt;20, &gt;70), (&gt;60, &gt;70) for the 2018-2019 season. Comparatively, the Tampa Bay Lightning (TBL) have far less shots taken from those corners. It seems very difficult to score shooting from near the goal line, yet BUF still shoots from there. TBL takes more shots around the centre region across the 3 seasons. We can see that from the TBL centre regions having more purple compared to BUF. This could explain their success in scoring more goals, winning more games, and winning the Stanley Cup as shooting from this region is more direct than locations further away or near the goal line. This does not picture the complete picture that explains the BUF‚Äôs struggles or the TBL‚Äôs success since shot maps only tell us locations from where shots were taken from. Other factors that affect a team‚Äôs success include their play style, passing, player movement and switches on the ice and goal percentage at each shot location.</p>
