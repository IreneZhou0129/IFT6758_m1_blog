Next, within Python code, it loops over the years and saves data properly. The downloaded JSON files are categorized by game types and years. 
```
JSON_data
│
└───regular_seasons
│   └───2016
│       │   2016020001.json
│       │   ...
│   
└───playoffs
│   └───2016
│       │   2016030111.json
│       |   ...
```
